## Problem
<p>Currently, users rely on a ticketing system to receive support and resolve recurring issues. This model, however, presents important challenges. A considerable number of tickets are repetitive, referring to problems that have already been identified and solved, which generates unnecessary rework for the support team. Consequently, the team’s efforts are often consumed by low-complexity requests, reducing their ability to focus on critical incidents and new demands. Furthermore, the information related to recurring problems is fragmented, limiting the generation of managerial insights and making it difficult to analyze trends, identify bottlenecks, and explore opportunities for improvement.
</p>

## Solution
<p>The proposal is to implement an intelligent knowledge search system that reduces repetitive ticket openings by providing quick and relevant consultations in a historical database of problems and solutions. The system works by processing the existing ticket database and enabling intelligent keyword searches, allowing end users to find answers autonomously. All consultations are recorded in real time, which not only improves operational efficiency but also generates valuable insights for both operational and managerial decision-making.
